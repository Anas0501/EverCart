To implement authentication

In frontend when you get the data of the user from firebase.
Firebase also allows us to get the idToken of the user

With that idToken we can find the data of the user in our backend.


Whenever we send request to server we will send idToken to the backend
On server we can use that idToken to find the data of the user

getCurrentUser
	- Get firebase userdata from the idToken
	- That userdata contains a uid
	- With that uid we get the userdata from our own database
	- const user= await User.find({ uid })
